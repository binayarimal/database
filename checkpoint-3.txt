List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE.

Explain the structure for each type of command.
To insert data with new columns and rows, the syntax is INSERT INTO products (id, name, price) VALUES  (11773, 'South Face Jacket', 174.99), where the columns are labled (id, name, price) and the values are (11773, 'South Face Jacket', 174.99). You can also add just the row by typing INSERT INTO products VALUES (11773, 'South Face Jacket', 174.99).To update you use the following syntax: UPDATE products SET price=159.99 WHERE id=11773;  this allows you to change the price value of the product table to 174.99 where the id is 11773.Both the SET and WHERE keywords can take multiple clauses.We can also change the price of a product by specifying both the id and the name. the syntax of the delete command is something like this:DELETE FROM products WHERE id=11776; this deletes the row in the products table where the id is 11776. Just like the update command, the WHERE keyword can take multiple caluses .

What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.
date
example: storing the dates for the monthly payments for rent of different people.
format : "5/25/16"

text
example: storing the names of people enrolled in a program.
format : "James Gordon"

boolean
example:Storing the like and unlike button in instagram.
format: TRUE FALSE

Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
First and last name.
text
Whether they sent in their RSVP.
boolean
Number of guests.
tinyint
Number of meals.
numeric

Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.
CREATE TABLE Wedding_Dinner(
FirstName text,
LastName text,
RSVP boolean,
Number_of_Guests tinyint(2),
Number_of_meals numeric(5,1)
);

Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.
 ALTER TABLE Wedding_Dinner ADD COLUMN ThankYou_Card boolean SET DEFAULT FALSE;

You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.
ALTER TABLE Wedding_Dinner DROP COLUMN Number_of_meals;

The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.
ALTER TABLE Wedding_Dinner ADD COLUMN TableNumber numeric;

The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.
DROP TABLE Wedding_Dinner;

Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

CREATE TABLE library(
ISBN text,
title text,
author text,
genre text,
publishing_date date,
available_copies smallint;



Find three books and add their information to the table.

 INSERT INTO library(ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing_date, available_copies)
  VALUES
  (1177-31234-2, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows', 'JK Rowling' 'Fantasy','12/01/2010',20),
  (1-234-1774-12, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F Scott Fitzgerald', 'Novel', '02/12/1925', 35),
  (123-11775-123, 'The Kite Runner','Khaled Hosseini','Historical Fiction', '05/29/2003', 60);
 
Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.
UPDATE library SET  available_copies=19 WHERE ISBN = 1177-31234-2

Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.
DELETE FROM library WHERE ISBN=1177-31234-2;

Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
id smallint(3),
name text,
year_launched year,
country_of_origin varchar(100),
description text,
orbiting_body text,
currently_operating boolean,
miles_from_earth decimal(30, 30)
)



Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.

INSERT INTO spacecrafts(id,name,year_launched,country_of_origin,description,orbiting_body,currently_operating,miles_from_earth)
VALUES
(245, "Axion25","China", "Mission Mars, Checking the atmosphere", "Mars", TRUE, 232123.12)
(125, "New Titanic","USA", "Search Life", "Venus", TRUE, 2321212343.12)
(895, "Interstellar 5","India", "Space Travel, colonize Milkyway", "Jupiter", TRUE,2345577321345.12345)


Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.
DELETE FROM speacecrafts WHERE id=245;

Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.
UPDATE spacecrafts SET currently_operating=FALSE WHERE id = 895;

Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

CREATE TABLE emails(
id text,
subject_line varchar(50)
sender text,
additional_recipients text,
body text,
timestamp timestamp,
read boolean
chain_id text,
)



Add three new emails to the inbox.

INSERT INTO emails(id,subject_line,sender,additional_recipients,body,timestamp,read,chain_id)
VALUES
("akasha.dipo@gmail.com","Office Supplies","Jamar@gmail.com","Hey I have a question regarding the office supplies", TIMESTAMP '2013-03-13 19:06:00',TRUE,"Jacob@hotmail.com"),
("Jamaya.Ripo@gmail.com","Finance","Jaraya@gmail.com","Hey I have a question regarding my Finance", TIMESTAMP '2012-03-20 19:26:30',TRUE,"Jason@hotmail.com"),
("Benjamin.dipo@gmail.com","Saturday plans","Jamar@gmail.com","Hey I have a question regarding saturday plans", TIMESTAMP '2018-03-12 05:06:23',FALSE,"Avi@hotmail.com");

You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
DELETE FROM emails WHERE id="akasha.dipo@gmail.com"

You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.
UPDATE emails SET read=FALSE WHERE id="Jamaya.Ripo@gmail.com"
